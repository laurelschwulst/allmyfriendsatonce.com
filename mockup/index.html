		When I get asked about anything dating back to when I was 15, it's either about sex or communism. It's not common to think that anything else important was happening to a teen living in Croatia in 1999, I was expected to procrastinate and enjoy it because it would soon stop. Communism fell apart in 91', then I had at least one crush per year ever since 97', and a little bit of internet in 99'. 56k to be exact. My grandfather offered me $100 to teach him how to install email on his phone, a landline--it was a white antenna phone turned yellow and when I picked it up I would hear the neighbor's conversation because they shared the phone number. He suggested also installing it on a TV remote control. I wish I took his offer now. He was 82 and the only person in the town who had a pager, no one knew how to page him in. Sometimes days would pass and I wouldn't get an email. I was queuing on Napster, 5 hours to download a 3 min song. There was no streaming. Some cracking and serials. When internet would die, I would restart the modem with a hair clip. All of my memories are of hardware--then I had more objects and experiences and now I have more information. My speakers were big enough to be a hidden storage for ten packs of cigarettes. The computer chair was uncomfortable; I got it from my stepfather, he used it for his math students that would come in for extra lessons. Because it was so uncomfortable, I have a lot of memories of it. I remember how I was unable to pull out the drawer with the keyboard because it would bump on hand holders on the chair. All the chairs I ever had since this were equally unfriendly. My older brother had porn on floppy-disks, they were all titled "System Files." It took me weeks to find the key of the transparent floppy disk box. When I finally did, it was all just a collection of funny 5 second-vids of women with horses and nothing I could really compare my experiences to. Apparently Dutch researchers doing a survey on pornography couldn't find enough people to who haven't at some point sought out porn online, to be able to form statistical control pool. Different versions of female-with-horse was my internet password for years, including my Chase online banking account. For a while there was just one big chat room that we could use--Iskrica (spark). Chances of running into someone you dis/liked IRL in a "Cyber-shh", a dark-room among Croatian chat-rooms, was as like 1:1000. Internet was loud and PC made white noise, wires needed to be stretched across the whole apartment and after each use folded back like ropes after climbing.

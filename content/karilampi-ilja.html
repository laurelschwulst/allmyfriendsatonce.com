Actually in Gothenburg there was StingNet before the internet.
</p>
<p>
In the daily tabloid Expressen, you could order the software on a floppy disk for 15 kronor, which allowed you to hook up to the BBS forum for youths they created; that is, if you had a modem. My friend Anton’s dad was a doctor and had his work email account available at home, so in the basement we could connect to StingNet. It was an early community where you could create your page and display your interests, though I hardly remember how the interface looked like.

We’ve just turned twelve in 1995. 
</p>
<p>
The phone line was always busy and we were asked to limit our hobby to late evenings. We chatted with girls from Stockholm, which we called up on their phone number once.
</p>
<p>
It got awkward.
</p>
<p>
IT was a big word in town, information technology.
</p>
<p>
At Lindholmen, the science center one could use Internet for free.
</p>
<p>
Me and my other mate André travelled for one hour with public transport just to use the bulky PC. We had to cue for an hour. When our turn, we mostly spent time on public chat rooms, like the one of another tabloid, Aftonbladet. As many others, we faked aliases, logged in and out, and ended sessions prematurely.
</p>
<p>
After that everything blew up pretty fast.
</p>
<p>
I once went on a blinddate with a girl in Borås after gettin to know each other on that same chatroom. It was a complete failure.
</p>
<p>
I was thirteen.
</p>
<p>
We had both sent pictures of ourselves to each other, only hers just reached me after the date was over. She said I was cute. 
</p>
<p>
I went on a one hour train through the snowy landscape.
</p>
<p>
She wasnt exactly my cup of chai, a loud obnoxious and in my eyes a not very attractive person, differing from what I had thought. She also brought along her friend who was constantly cracking bad jokes and laughing, contributing even more to the awkward pubescent atmosphere as we smoked Kents without filters and tried to find a way to spend the hours until I was going back to Göteborg.
</p>
<p>
I can’t believe these days when I flip out if there’s ever any sudden glitch in the strong wireless internet connection while I’m multitasking with ten tabs open and all kinds of embeddable media & prestanda running.
</p>
<p>
There was a time where you’d wait for more than a minute to see the low-quality jpeg or gif reveal in front of your eyes, from top to bottom, in slow, saucy rows, only to realize that it was totally just softporn.

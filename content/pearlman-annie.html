In the early America Online days, probably 95 or 96, when I was around 13 and really into the in-die and underground music and Funkadelic, I would chat with strangers in music forum chat rooms.

I remember one time I was in a private chat with an older guy and he complimented me for being so young and into things he liked.  After maybe a few days of chatting online—and at his asking—I gave him my phone number.  I remember being wary of what information I gave him and of him being possibly pervy.   I’d trade live tapes of shows and rare stuff through mail with people I met online, but a little later I think, and those relationships were based on object exchanges where this was purely social.  At this time, the computer was in a public downstairs area in my house, which wasn’t my favorite, but with the cordless phone I had privacy.  I would have been happy to continue just chatting online though.

I don’t remember much, it was pretty unmemorable I think.  He didn’t seem pervy, except for wanting to talk to a kid like me and maybe asking for too much info initially, like where I lived in Vermont.  There were some off music topics discussed, and I knew we were both reaching out in the dark in a lonely way.  But besides maybe talking about general feelings towards life and routine, we knew to keep it light.  The calls would have been less censored and resultantly a little less bland if both parties didn’t feel awkward about the prevailing circumstances. And he didn’t seem dreamy or hilarious, so I wasn’t dying to talk to him a bunch.

It was overall a fine, positive experience for me at the time.  Attention from the kind of people I sought attention from.  Information exchange.  Filling boredom.  I never liked anyone at school romantically, and put a lot of emphasis on the ability to meet more of the kinds of people I’d like to meet as an independent person / college student / outside of Vermont / wherever I could meet the most people / NYC.  Everything else felt limiting.

I always wanted to live in NYC, since forever.  It offered the most options and the ability to be anonymous. The internet was this before I could move out.  Now I live in NY and am mostly online at home.

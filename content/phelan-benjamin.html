One of the first websites I remember visiting, or at least made a big impression on me was www.Amazing1.com. I had seen an ad in the back of a popular science magazine for a laser listening device that would let you spy on neighbors by bouncing a laser beam off their window. I was in middle school, this was maybe 96, I had already purchased an “electronic ear” (hearing aid), and spying was the most exciting thing I could imagine at the time. I was hanging out in my father’s office one weekend and had access to a computer there. I remember entering the url; www.Amazing1.com and having my mind blown. On the front page were hyperlink categories like LASERS , TESLA COILS, ULTRASONIC SHOCK WAVE DEVICES, ANTI GRAVITY, and MIND CONTROL. Amazing1 was the web site of Information Unlimited, a New Hampshire mail order catalog operating since the 70’s, selling alternative science books and custom electronic devices. This was my first exposure to alt science and the way the web page presented working electronic devices alongside hypothetical devices legitimized everything in my mind. The brilliant structure of Information Unlimited’s web business made it all appear accessible; every device, from a Phone Transmitter to the “experimental” Phased Pain Ray Gun was available on a graduated scale, the plans were $10 , the kits $60, and assembled working devices prohibitively expensive. Attracted to the warnings to “check local laws” and “use with discretion”, I ended up ordering a “super value sale” of wireless transmitters kits. The set included plans and parts to bug phone lines, home in on tracking signals, and transmit my own TV station. I couldn’t figure out how to build any of it, but I still credit www.Amazing1.com for shaping the way I thought about electronics. Everything on the site was built from standard components, a universal system inside everything; in the right configuration, it was capable of anything if enough people wanted it.

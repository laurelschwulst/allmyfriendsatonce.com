In my early teen years,  my extracurricular life was preoccupied by Xanga and MSN messenger. My overprotective mother wouldn’t let me stay out with friends afterschool, so while I missed drunken beach parties and karoake sessions with the popular girls, I played Neopets, updated my blogs and lurked my first crush on MSN. Neopets was really addictive despite its simple web design. I enjoyed visiting the different hotlinked “environments” that were demonstrated by a hand-drawn map that had clickthrough links to different areas in Neopia. I suspect I was more addicted to the battle games because my connection was too slow and I would always lose since I could not make a move as quick as the opponent user’s pet.

I signed onto MSN right after school and stay on until around midnight. I changed profile pictures and screennames constantly. I put sensational lyrics from Garbage and J. Lo on the customizable status field. I really admired Jennifer Lopez's sass and sexiness and for a while I changed my msn or icq name to “ⓙⓔⓝⓝⓨ ⓕⓡⓞⓜ ⓣⓗⓔ ⓑⓛⓞⓒⓚ” in unicode, even though I was short, scrawny and ugly, but I wanted people to see me in that light.  My mother taunted me on never getting into university because I spent all my free time on MSN. Because my computer was in the living room she would hover around me to see who I was talking to. I quickly learned to use Alt+Tab to switch applications quickly.  I was so excited I was to watch my highschool crushes sign on. I wouldn’t really talk about anything deep with them, just “sup” (what’s up) and “nm” (nothing much) but I was excited to be talking to that other eighth-grade boy who flirted with me on the schoolbus back home. I eventually told him I liked him (on MSN). He avoided me for the rest of the year.

My first Asian Avenue page was called “darkchyld” and I photoshopped an image of a girl with a lens flare over her right eye specifically for the background. I was into images of women as cool, sultry and mysterious, and I wanted myself to be seen as such. I customized my AA page and Xanga header compulsively after looking at the pages of other popular, pretty girls. Every comment on Xanga garnered two “eprops” and I commented voraciously on other girls' blogs in hopes that they would comment back. I think 30 eprops was about as high as I got per post, and envied those who got 70. If it wasn't possible to be popular at school, you could at least appear popular on the web. Using the simplistic HMTL editor in Asian Avenue, I learned to create scrolling marquee text and to replace my cursor with a magic wand pointer.

In grade 10 I started hiking my ugly grey uniform skirt up and wearing eyeliner to school. I played Diablo briefly to try and get with this nerdy guy in my math class. After passing him a few notes and adding him on MSN, he became my boyfriend for two weeks, but we were so shy around each other that we just walked to the buses afterschool together and talked on MSN for the rest of the time. We used the smiley and heart emotes a lot. Then on the second week he sent me this really long email full of love poems and hearts and I freaked out. Was he really in love with me? I wasn’t sure I wanted to kiss him and I couldnt even look at his face for more than five seconds! I broke up with him on MSN, and we never talked to each other at school again. MSN seemed to be the way to say things that were too embarassing and hard to say in person.

I got tired of trying to be being pretty and popular, and ignored my concerned mother in grade 11. I got an eyebrow piercing, started smoking cigarettes, met my first boyfriend at a rock show.  We texted and talked on the phone all night and took pictures of ourselves together. I made them (and him) my profile pictures. I was in love. Along with posting extreme photomanipulations of myself and other stock image girls as beautifully tragic goth princesses. I felt good that a circle of 20 people or so were “faving” my work, or adding it to their “Favourites” online art collection. DeviantArt and Xanga were the places for what I thought of as genuine artistic expression of anger, darkness and depression.

Once too many friends from other schools found out about a new Xanga account I would shut it down and start a new one. I enjoyed imagining that other sad teens I didn’t know or meet before would be reading my writing. I named the accounts after lyrcis from my favourite bands, like “bleedtomysenses” or “takemebacksevenyears”. I abandoned the glitzy graphics in favor of something somber and literary in my late teens.  I went from comic sans to Georgia and Times New Roman, italicizing certain song lyrics to give the reader emphasis. I copied screamo song lyrics lyrics and rearranged them with others, taking then reposted them. It was like my friends and I competed over how depressed or fucked up we were. “Cheer up emo kid”, we would comment sarcastically.

The emotional hardcore lifestyle seemed to have kids running to the pre-2.0 internet as a means of uninhibitedly expressing their anger and sadness. I perused LiveJournal for gifs and icons of tragic-romantic song lyrics. While the popular kids posted photos of themselves smoking and clubbing, my friends and I shared and hosted pictures of our drinking escapades on Photobucket and embedded them on our Myspace pages. I friend-requested bands no one had ever heard of as friends and changed my Top 8 according to who I interacted with most on the site. I  met metalheads and hardcore kids from other schools and went to music shows with them. The profile picture, your favorite bands, and your tagline was probably the most important to indicating your authenticity to “emo”. No one was supposed to call themselves emo as that would be the most poseurly, try-hard thing to do.

DeviantArt-along with MySpace-became a way of browsing and checking out other scenekids in Hong Kong. I considered my online activity to express a healthy amount of indulgent pessimism; my mom was not happy with my uploading of scratchy manipulated photos to the “Dark Art” section of Devianart. It was not art to her. I made album covers for hong kong metalcore bands and local show posters; I felt appreciated. Emo kids in Hong Kong tried double hard to look like emo kids when the right attire and venues weren’t around to make them look like that. My boyfriend and his friends pooled money to order bandshirts from HotTopic.com with my friends' parents credit card. MySpace and a forum site called LLNR.biz (Live Life No Rules) with all the rock show listings in town would keep the Hong Kong hardcore (HKHxC) scene together.

As my friends fled Xanga for MySpace, we began using the group messaging options on the social network to arrange hangouts. We spent late nights filling in personality questionnaires that were circulating through messages.  “Do you prefer vanilla or chocolate?” “Are you vegan or vegetarian?” “Would you date someone bisexual?”“What type of kisser are you?”  For a moment these trivial and lengthy question-and-answer questionnaires became definers of developing personalities. Quiz banners and badges decorated our profiles alongside song lyrics and Photoshopped band images.  When my first serious boyfriend and I broke up later I voiced my public heartbreak as I changed my screennames and blogged about it with sad song lyrics constantly. I made a black and white photo of us kissing titled “goodbyes are sad” and put it on DeviantArt.

Throughout highschool I made and abandoned seven xangas with various poetic headlines. I made my blog part of blogrings with emo titles, such as “  Much later in my teens I started a Xanga blog as a way to document my restrictive dieting activity. I was obsessed with food, nutrition and weight loss and  foodlogging and it could more or less be considered part of the “pro ana” community. In my late teens xanga became a completely isolated and private blog for me to work ritualistically on my eating disorder. I voraciously recorded the types and amount of food I ate in each entry and lamented how fat or ugly I was. Most entries just contained two-liner laments on how fat I felt that day because of what I ate. I surfed other eating disordered Xanga blogs to feel connected to people as miserable as I was. I spent three hours everyday looking up food information on TheDailyPlate.com ( now LiveStrong.com) and read foodie blogs with envy, disgust, and curiosity. Foodporn was quite scintillatingly pornographic as I could smell food from yards away, yet would never bring myself to eat it despite my persistent hunger. Looking at images of food seemed to allow me to appreciate without consuming. I forgot how I was able to remove myself from the cycle of deep research on how fats, carbs, and proteins were processed in the body. I stopped frequenting these corners of the web after I received an email about a close male friend dying from anorexia. This was somehow the end of my Xanga era and I moved onto blogspot to write occasional generalist, cultural criticism.

I stopped blogging altogether in my early Twenties, and updated my Facebook occasionally as I was working hard on my eating disorder in secrecy. I didn’t really feel like I could really connect to others after moving to Toronto, but became pre-occupied with looking for people who had the same activisitc interests in university. Sex education, AIDS Walk, treeplanting, internships and vegetarian food festivals filled in my extracurricular activities and I briefly forgot I had a history of indulgent depression, obsessive surfing, and disordered eating on the web. I have stopped talking to all of my Top 8 friends–not that we fell out, but we have nothing to talk about. I think I only know one person who continued to be a (doom) metalhead, and he moved to Vancouver and started multiple MySpace band pages.

One day in 2008 I decided to look at my old Myspace again and discovered the profile, along with my sixteen-year-old partying pics were syndicated on PeekYou.com. I immediately shut down the Myspace account and emailed PeekYou.com multiple times over the course of the next to stop them from displaying my profile information. I became horrified where teen images of me smoking and partying or selfie-ing had ended up. I untagged photos of myself from my teen years and deleted my highschool exes and their friends from Facebook. I set out to make private or shutdown any old blog accounts I could remember. I still hope no one from highschool remembers my Xanga posts, but I bet they do. People often think the superfluous information they post about themselves gets lost in the stream, but in fact it stays on the web and goes nowhere. Whatever I have posted under old pseudonyms are still floating around online, stagnant and undiscovered. In many ways these are parts of my digital body that I want to disown or deny were mine, but are perhaps are the most illustrative of my unstable and compulsive character.

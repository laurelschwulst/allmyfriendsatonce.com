In the spring of my twelfth year, I became an Internet celebrity. My Sailor Moon website had just made the links list of a larger, seriously authoritative Sailor Moon website, and I was awarded the top prize in an AOL/<i>RENT</i> essay-writing contest: tickets to <i>RENT</i> (Boston…).  On Friday and Saturday nights, while I “babysat” my younger brothers, I’d distribute my many online responsibilities across our two family computers, downstairs downloading original Sailor Jupiter transformation clips (with the sexily allusive body contouring that dropped out of the American versions) and upstairs running chat room meetings about a less-than-important <i>RENT</i> (<i>Broadway</i>) ensemble member, so selected to ensure ours would be the first (and, unsurprisingly, only) fan club. Of course, on one or both computers, as speed and discretion would allow, I also peeped a shit ton of porn.

On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a homosexual, though your family may have an inkling.  What can I say?  I was an indiscriminately horny young fuck, and many evenings, while my brothers horsed around in the basement, I sat myself down in my father’s study to let my trigger finger go wild. During one such concourse with the United Colors of beefcakes, I clicked on a Swede with long, flaxen hair, coaxing his Baseline JPEG to striptease in 28.8 time.  And some way into that striptease, a younger brother caught me with my pants down and muttered, “You pervert.”
</p>
<p>
I’ve replayed this moment thousands of times, trying to build a case that “pervert,” whilst acknowledging me as a horny young fuck, did not thereby imply that I was a horny young <i>homo</i> fuck (that secret was mine to disclose). As best I could measure – gauging the viewing angle, accounting for possible monitor glare – my brother espied a tanned body with long, flaxen hair and an amply endowed chest. As best I could hope, the JPEG was so early in its Baseline strip as to keep this body’s gender provisional…

Throughout my teenage years, I felt at the mercy of my brother: the Internet came out on my behalf, and he was privileged to witness the ceremony. At sixteen, I took that ceremony on the road, yet even though my secret no longer carried any power, the fraternal strife persisted.  
</p>
<p>
I finally sat down with my brother roughly eight years after the event. For the first time, I plotted the full narrative, including the thousands of forensic recalls and the vague, lingering dread. He gave me a blank stare, remarking, “I don’t remember any of that” and went on to describe what he considered to be the moment, roughly eight years ago (in the very same study!), which fundamentally, seismically shaped our relationship.  I stared blankly back.

<p>
So we sat and twiddled out thumbs for a few minutes, wondering if our years of unspoken tension truly derived from competing, half-remembered origins. I looked sheepish and felt like a bit (or a lot) of an idiot, and gradually, we got on with it.

When I was fourteen I'd spend the summers with my mom in south Tacoma. In the basement I would download screenplays with Limewire, learn about actors, read medical journals i didn't understand and random things. Most of my life I had a debilitating speech impediment. This translated online so I would labor over a single IM for 45min. It was only a few years ago that my speech got better but I still spend hours writing and rewriting messages.

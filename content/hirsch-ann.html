<h2>The first time I cyberbullied</h2>

<p>
The summer after 8th grade I met a boy online through a mutual friend. We met up at the Owings Mills movie theater and I let him finger me and I gave him a handjob and we kissed a bunch in the back row. 
</p>
<p>
These were my very first sexual escapades. I told my best friend every last juicy detail in confidence.
</p>
<p>
She told a boy from our school named Alex every last one of these juicy details. And then Alex told everyone else from our grade at school. They all made fun of me. Alex was the relentless ringleader. I had told my best friend the boy had fingered me four times. Alex and his friends would run past me and yell FOUR TIMES and I would hate myself.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t care so much that people knew my business, knew the things I had done. I was actually proud of my accomplishments. It was more that I was mad at the way these boys, led by Alex, were making me feel about what I had done. That I was not only a slut, but also stupid for not even understanding the sexual actions themselves. 
</p>
<p>
I thought with time the taunting would go away. But to Alex, my shame was a funny joke, which he liked to reiterate time after time, depending on if this joke fit the context of the conversation. My fingering was a part of his repertoire.
</p>
<p>
I was mad. And I would get even.
</p>
<p>
I obtained a love letter Alex had written that same summer to a friend of mine. It was filled with professions of love, long-winded self-deprecations, and the qualities she contained that fueled his passion. For a boy to be so forthright with his emotions at such a young age was rare, and, if exposed, could mean his demise. Especially since his letter was met with pure rejection. Ah, my poor heartbroken enemy…I have you now.
</p>
<p>
I copied and pasted the contents of his letter to my AIM profile—in those days, a highly visible outlet. I immediately felt an incredible amount of joy, self satisfaction and inner peace. Revenge, you taste so sweet.
</p>
<p>
For a while, I heard nothing from Alex directly. Some of our friends said I should take it down and that I was being mean. I left it up. I knew Alex was furious inside. I would hear our friends tease him about his love scorned and their taunts would play over in my head like a beautiful melody.  The words “Four Times” had stopped coming out of his and everyone else’s mouth. 
</p>
<p>
One average day, about six months later, Alex caved. 
</p>
<p>
Alex369: ann<br />
annipo0: alex<br />
Alex369: will you please take the letter down now?<br />
annipo0: aw but i love it its so sweet<br />
Alex369: please ann. i never beg. but im now begging you to please take it down. and i have put up with it as long as i possibly could but it has been so long. will you please just take it down?<br />
annipo0: i will take it down as long as you promise never ever to mess with me ever again. and if you do or if i hear youve been making fun of me i will put up the letter and never take it down ever.<br />
Alex369: i promise i wont ever again just please take it down now<br />
annipo0: ok i will<br />
Alex369: ok will u take it down right now though?<br />
annipo0: yes im doing it now!<br />
Alex369: i see that. thank you
</p>
<p>
The battle was over. I had won. I mainly felt proud of myself for outsmarting such a self-important asswipe. 
</p>
<p>
I can only assume that it was out of pure fear that Alex kept his word. And I was free to be fingered to my heart’s content without shame.

<h2>Adverse Possession</h2>

My most visceral internet memories are my most inaccessible, for they happened on moderated online political forums that are so guarded or irrelevant they have pretty much ceased to exist. The content of threads, and comments in these communities are not stored in one place, say one’s own page, but in the body of communication as a whole. In reality, you’re just a squatter: gaining title to the property on a temporary basis by open, hostile, and continuous confrontation with he who owns the domain and for only as long as you can keep it up or until they bulldoze the whole thing and start over.

I went to a prestigious private high school in suburban Detroit. I moved there from Aspen, Colorado, where everyone has so much money that you could forget it was even something to consider, so I wasn’t used to the flashy way my high school classmates showed off their wealth and felt doubly guilty about coming from it myself. I dealt with this shame and my disconnect with peers in two ways: by hanging out with dropout drug addicts and coffee shop anarchists and navigating livejournal communities.
</p>
<p>
I eventually found my way to the CrimethInc LJ community and thought that if I could embody their perspective intellectually, it would separate me from those Lily Pulitzer wearing conserva-trons I went to school with. I recall a thread about squatters’ rights. I wrote a comment about crust punks in southeastern Michigan and the value of commercial real estate insuiant and, in lieu of critical response they deduced I was a rich bitch and that I should eat shit and die. I was of the mindset that it was ones ideas that mattered where as a common goal is concerned and that one needs allies on all sides of any matter, but to them, I was always wrong. They sure as hell didn’t want my parallax poseur perspective. 
</p>
<p>
Years of resentment boiled into a creepy proto-libertarian-style patriotism, set aflame by the financial crisis and the movies I watched on Google video like <em>Spare Change</em> and <em>Zeitgeist Addendum</em>. 2008 was a strange and terrifying time. The extreme right and the extreme left had nearly identical beliefs: 9-11 was an inside job, FEMA camps were going to gas anyone with a credit score below 650.  Glenn Beck and Russia Today were equally good sources for what was new with the New World Order. Ron Paul was the new Che Guevara. I lived in South Florida, joined the Campaign for Liberty and made credit card paintings.
</p>
<p>
A year later, I’m living in New York City and working in credit card processing. I was responsible for the merchant side of things: setting up and managing their accounts, fee schedules, credit card terminals, tracking of funds, and taking a whole lot of crap on the behalf of Big Credit. To many an unhappy small-business owner, I was the shootable messenger. I had to understand, inside and out, the language and consequences of the financial regulatory data that passed through my fingers so I could explain and justify it to my merchants, in addition to enacting it. And this made me mad. I noticed that around the time the Credit CARD Act of 2009 entered the legislature, Visa and MasterCard began releasing congruent per swipe fees that the proposed reforms could never address because they didn’t understand the industry jargon. Instead the lawmakers focused on interchange rates (virtually unchanged since 1992) and debit card transactions fees. 
</p>
<p>
I would moan about this endlessly in comments I left on New York Times’ finance blog and watch strings of suggested videos, from Mises Institute lectures on Keynesian economics to flyover nightvision footage of potential FEMA death camps. I was a self-proclaimed affiliate member of The Zeitgeist Movement (TZM), an anarcho-activist group concerned with exposing the global financial conspiracy.) I trolled TZM forums for the latest in conspiracy and tried to make art about or with it.  When I heard about the mother load of meet-ups, worldwide “Z-Day 2010,” and saw that TZM figureheads Peter Joseph (maker of <em>Zeitgeist Addendum</em>) and Jacque Fresco (father of <em>The Venus Project</em>) would be at the NYC event, I considered the $30 advanced ticket a materials cost and threw down. In the interim I searched for potential opportunities for conceptual art-making to coincide with the event, to no avail. There were no calls for art or artists on the forum. No one was responding to my threads or my emails to the local organizers. I figured I would just improvise at the gathering. 
</p>
<p>
I arrived at the Friends Seminary downtown, where the event is taking place It’s pouring rain, steamy as the gates of hell, and already I’m bored. I got my badge and took my seat in the pews. The lectures were painful, or recycled. I found some guys who look like stoners and get high during intermission in the basement. It looked like the q&a would be my only chance to make an art. I spent the keynotes drafting a doosey of a two-part question. 
</p>
<p>
First, to Peter Joseph, I inquire as to the inability for an independent artist, such as myself, to lend themselves creatively to TZM without being instructed to simply run some shit graphic to Kinkos and having their voice, perspective, and conceptual practice completely stifled by TZM gatekeepers, who are accordingly missing out on a huge opportunity for greater cultural infiltration. Joseph, a shade embarrassed and a little flustered, insisted that urgency of the impending socio-economic crisis required individuals to sideline their self-concern, and so be it, expression, for the greater good, and that what TZM really need right now are people to disseminate his film and through activism, drive people to the Venus Project. 
</p>
<p>
Then to Jacque Fresco, I inquired as to the role of the artist in his vision of the future, a pre-planned, non-monetary resource-based technocracy (<em>The Venus Project</em>.) Keep in mind, this guy is a 94 year old, Brooklyn-born depression era curmudgeon whose entire project is basically a fantasy-communist Vito Acconci Studios that makes nothing. In other words, he’s an artist.  He fumed for 20 minutes about how artists like me are vain psychopathic frauds who will have no place in his future society of abundance and no value in the current one save to please the bourgeoisie and if he could rid the world of artists today it would be a better place. 
</p>
<p>
His tirade ended and so did the q&a session. I was swarmed by TZMers, asking me if I had a mailing list, if I was starting a new more welcoming faction, if I wanted to hear a rejected protest song. I felt like Jesus. 
</p>
<p>
The first speaker, a lackey, made a huge deal about how the whole thing, including q&a, was being broadcasted for the world to see unedited via ustream, so I ran back to my friend Nick’s in DuMBo to have someone bear witness to this messiah-like experience. We go to the ustream feed and it’s there: my question followed by Jacque Fresco making himself look like a completely out of touch asshole. The crowd is cheering me. It’s a madhouse. I’m pretty sure I’ve finally made my mark in this fringe world that has forsaken me all these years. 
</p>
<p>
I wake up the next morning and the video is gone. The links to all the other segments of the q&a are intact, save for mine. In place is the message, “this video has been removed by the moderator ;)” on a black screen. In the TZM forum, I find countless threads about the “the art question.” I started my own on the conspiracy of the censorship of the ustream feed. Before long, I was confronted by username ZMTVmoderator who did little to hide that it was he who delighted in removing the video. He deleted my comments, misquoted me, mocked my poor html skills, bombarded me with out-of-context passages from the densest Marxist literature and nitpicked every rebuttal so unyieldingly I had time for nothing else. And he had the power -- every other comment was a reminder he could have me thrown from the forum at his will, and how I’d better watch what I say. Eventually I gave in, told him he was a douche and got kicked out. 
</p>
<p>
There is a fragility about one’s inclusion in these online communities, and in the very nature of the communities themselves. Exchange is heavily monitored due to a foundational paranoia and a lot of ego (I mean, its career activists, conspiracy theorists, communists, and anarchists we’re talking about here) and even if you play the game long enough to be allowed in, anyone could flag you, a moderator could block your account, or some webmaster could simply wipe the whole thing. I can’t see anything on my livejournal from before 2006, the CrimethInc page has been purged, and in 2013, The Zeitgeist Movement deleted their entire forum and started over. I guess you’ll have to take my word any of this happened at all.

The first time I can remember using the internet was to look up cheat codes for Aladdin on Sega Genesis, probably in 1993 or 94. Really, my dad did all the searching, I had a very vague understanding of what going online meant, and even what it looked like on that first computer is hazy at best. For years, the only thing I can remember from the web was that same stack of sega genesis cheat codes, printed on dot matrix paper with a staple in the left hand corner.

Later I started to dabble in chat rooms, mostly to pretend that I was older and knew stuff about punk rock. I didn’t go all the way down the rabbit hole until I discovered message boards, around 1997 or 98. Coincidentally it was searching for cheat codes that brought me there, this time for my green Game Boy Pocket. I preferred message boards to chat rooms because unlike the rapid fire speed of chats, the boards allowed you to really take time to carefully compose your dumb opinions and made-up personas. The important thing for me about both chat rooms and message boards is that you were lying to strangers about basically nothing. Eventually I migrated out of the Game Boy message boards and onto the indie rock boards, then out into larger communities without any specific topic.

At one point the message board system I was on allowed people to start using icons next to their username. In a move that seems really crazy now, the admins forced users to chose from a pre-approved set of icons, and weren’t allowed to upload their own content. After awhile they opened up the icons to submission, but only through a very subjective approval process from this one guy named Warb. I got pretty good at making icons, at first just for things I would want to use myself, but eventually onto taking requests from people.

I had a few friends who were moderators of the boards, so I’d make funky lil gif animations incorporating their username into the image, a perk that only mods were allowed. Eventually I built up enough favor from making icons for them to be made into a mod myself, even though I didn’t take the rules seriously and had gotten banned a few times already. I started to abuse my power immediately, deleting and editing posts, and going deep into the admin panel to add stupid little jokes into the system. It didn’t take long for my mod powers to be revoked and for me to be banned from the boards, but they let me keep my custom icon.

I stayed friendly with people from the boards for a while after I peaced out, chatting on AIM fairly often. It turned out that the icon mod, Warb, lived not too far from me in Seattle, so we ended up hanging out once. We met in the basement of the Westlake mall, which was the bus tunnel entrance and also where all the best stores were located: EB Games, Sam Goody and Suncoast Video. Warb was actually the first person from the internet that I met away from keyboard, and it soured me on meeting up with anybody else for a long time. There was nothing wrong with him—just a friendly nerdy guy who was really into DVDs—the problem was me. I wasn’t ready yet for the two versions of myself to collide with each other. I knew that when the online and offline versions of myself merged, the fictionalized one would be absorbed into my normal self, and I didn’t want to give that narrative up. In intervening years I think that the fiction and reality of the internet has gotten a lot more subtle, or at least I’m just not worried about it anymore.

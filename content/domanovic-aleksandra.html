My name is Mirjana Tasić.  For the last 20 years I have been mainly working with computer networks. I began my career at the beginning of the 1970s when mainframe computers were first installed in our country.  I was lucky enough to do my traineeship in the Yugoslav Railway computer centre where I could study to become a system engineer.

I enrolled in electrical engineering studies in 1965.  Female students were in the minority although no less than 50 of us enrolled that year.  This was quite a revolution at the Belgrade Electrical Engineering Faculty. In the third year, we could choose some computer courses.

In 85, I started to work at the Serbian Statistical Office.  Computer networks started to develop at that time, but they weren't like the Internet today. They were mainly private and based on one central computer, a main frame, which expanded its network to facilitate data acquisitions.  We had two groups of networks back then. One for Europe...I think it was established in the 1980s and was called European Academic Research Network or EARN, while the one in the US, based on the same technology was called BITNET.  Both networks used IBM network technology.

At the same time, another network was being developed in the US.  It later became the Internet.  At first it was called ARPANET, but changed name to INTERNET at the end of the 1980s.  For us, this INTERNET was something far far away.  But colleagues heard about EARN and that was the way forward for Yugoslavia, which was in "no-man's land" just in front and not behind the Iron Curtain, to join.

The academic community in Europe on the other hand started to search for alternatives to IBM.  One of them was the ISO model which was very complex.  A few experiments were made on some parts of the network in Europe and the results were downright disastrous.  When ISO was removed from the academic network in the early 1990s, the Internet started to emerge from the other side of the ocean.  I found it very interesting in the same way as any young person wants to see inventions in her field.

I managed to get and read the principles of the Internet protocol and they astonished me. I said: “People, this is going to overrun the entire planet!"  The concept was fantastic!

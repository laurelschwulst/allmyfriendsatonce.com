To talk about my first memories of the Internet is to talk about my memories of my basement. To talk about my basement circa the early nineties is to talk about escape plots. Itâ€™s where my parents and my siblings and I went to get away from each other.

<p>
My parents would claim to their friends that the basement was half-finished, but looking back I see it more as an unfinished basement.  
</p>

The basement was almost no longer the house, but a staging area to slip out from underneath the house. I think it is human nature not to go down into an unfinished basement without an agenda.

My dad went down to the basement to work, to telecommute, he used Trumpet Winsock before I remember seeing any AOL discs in the mail or heard any of my classmates talk about chat rooms. I would try to connect after he left in the morning, but the settings never seemed to work.

Later my mom would set up a travel agency in the basement, none of her clients knew she was in a basement, why would they? In retrospect, nothing says escape fantasy like setting up a travel agency in an unfinished basement.

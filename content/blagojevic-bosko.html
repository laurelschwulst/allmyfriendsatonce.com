When I was sixteen, I was in a strange place in the world. I was homeless, penniless and with no real direction in my life. I had no desire to pull myself out of the gutter. Although I often found myself without the basic necessities of food and shelter, I had a steady supply of drugs that were dispensed, I suppose, out of sympathy by many of my friends. I went to sleep hungry and cold every night, but rarely sober. At some point that year, I decided to start collecting my experiences in some writing. Notes, a journal: my memoirs, perhaps. I didn’t want to be so fatal about it, but some part of me saw it as a real last-ditch effort. The future seemed absurd, so I thought: what the fuck? One afternoon I walked into a rather desolate RideAid and stole a black and white composition notebook and a decent gel-roller black pen.
</p>
<p>
This will do, I thought.
</p>
<p>
That night I found myself at a squat party on the eastern end of town. A tall older guy I had never seen before approached me a little after midnight and handed me a small bag full of some sort of plant.
</p>
<p>
“What’s this?” I asked.
</p>
<p>
“Jimson Weed. If you eat the seeds, you’ll trip hard. Maybe you can sell it. I don’t want it.”
</p>
<p>
He told me to split the pod open and eat half of the seeds if I wanted to trip really hard. To me that meant eat the whole pod since recommended dosages tend to be boring. 
I chose not to eat the seeds that night, since I was already really tired and afraid I would fall asleep before the effects kicked in. I slept on a wooden park bench and I woke up around five in the morning to the freezing February wind. I stood up and shook the slumber off, starting my walk downtown and taking strides to try and raise my body temperature. Such an hour in a small city offers very little in terms of recreation, so I decided it was the time to open the doors of perception and have a little psychedelic breakfast. 
I chose the largest pod in the bag, which was also the darkest in color (I was told afterward the most potent seeds are the deepest brown). The seeds were terribly bitter, I choked almost immediately. I was determined to force it down and wrangled my tongue desperately trying to push the foul matter further down my throat. I could feel the shells getting stuck in my teeth.
</p>
<p>
Finally I managed to finish the entire pod with a little help from a public water fountain. I found another little park and watched a beautiful sunrise sitting on top of some rather bare grass, constantly waiting for the effects of the Jimson Weed to begin. 
</p>
<p>
I can't say how long I sat there until the seeds started working but the first signs came in the form of extreme thirst and general physical discomfort. Finding the feelings of seeming dehydration too strong to ignore, I went to a nearby McDonald's for free ice water. That’s an old squatter trick: those big corporate places are run by scripts, you just have to know the right line to say, you have to have the password. There is a lot of shit you can get for free, whether it’s ice water or the restroom keys. Anyway, it must have already been after 9 because the only people in the restaurant were old guys getting free refills on senior citizen discounted coffee. I sat in a booth in the back corner, sipping water through a cracked straw, watching the thirsty elderly redneck parade. It didn't take long for me to realize I was entering into a very hallucinogenic trip. The fact that I hadn't eaten a real meal in a week and was severely sleep deprived probably added to the drug's intensity, but I can't imagine a big dinner and a full eight-hours bed rest would have made too much of a difference. 
</p>
<p>
Unlike the onset of an E or acid trip, my mental state was very comfortable but my physical condition felt quite weird. The heavy sense of inebriation was quickly followed by powerful, disorienting visuals. Though they weren't disturbing, they seemed as clear as sunlight. Black cats milled about the floor in front of me, so numerous I couldn't even see the tile. They appeared wet and angry. 
</p>
<p>
There was deep crimson blood dripping from the ceiling. Also: Everything was technicolor. The sense of detachment was strong, but it didn't feel strange myself. Each hallucination flowed into the next. I was holding a very old bible in my lap. I couldn't figure out how to open it. Soon it started to leak blood, too. The more I struggled, the more it bled. As soon as I realized my efforts were futile, the book dissolved into the air around me. It didn't seem strange to me. When I analyzed the room again it was a bustling, futuristic metropolis. It appeared very large and very alien, with shining chrome and flashing lights everywhere. I began to feel discomfort and the strong urge to urinate. 
</p>
<p>
I staggered into the bathroom and vomited in the closest urinal, right in front of an Amish man. Now, I live in south central Pennsylvania, so it's very possible that he was really there, but considering my state and other people's accounts of Datura-induced visuals, I suspect he was just a hallucination. I do know that I relieved myself somewhere in the bathroom and left through the side exit adjacent to the lavatory door. The street outside was a scene of WWII-ravaged Europe. I don't know which country, but everyone on the street was garbed in Nazi military uniform. I felt very threatened. I ran into the alley behind the parking lot and hid behind a discarded pine tree. 
</p>
<p>
The anxiety soon ebbed, but the thirst and need to urinate returned. I knew I needed a comfort zone, a place I could relax in. A friend lived nearby. I walked to his apartment complex and stood in front of the stairwell. The same crimson blood from the McDonald's was cascading down his steps. It began to rise over my shoes, up my legs. A heavy sense of vertigo came over me. There's a memory gap between the stairs and my friend’s apartment, but I ended up on his couch watching dolphins dive through the wall in a seamless loop. During my time there, I experienced the typical non-existent cigarette search and the disappearing person puzzle. I visited the bathroom many times, but eliminated very little. The sense of dehydration was unbearable! There was no comfort. I didn't recognize the people in the room. 
</p>
<p>
I asked the person closest to me where Bill was. 
</p>
<p>
“Bill's not here,” was the return. I closed my eyes to escape the growing sense of panic. But when my eyelids shut, all I saw was a new room with new people. Where was I? I tried to reopen my eyes, but it only revealed another room with yet more strangers. This went on and on. I didn't know if my eyes were open or shut. I didn't know where I was, what time it was or what was happening. My panic turned into sensory collapse. Every thing bled together and I felt a deep spiraling sensation engulf me. I lost all visual capabilities, but I still had a very real sense of touch. I was trapped in a small metallic box. It made perfect sense to me. 
</p>
<p>
I was dead. This was hell. There were no demons, no hellfire or brimstone, just a deep, complete feeling of darkness and hopelessness. This was the never-ending void. Not at all how I had imagined it, but worse than I thought that it could have been. I've had feelings of infinite emotion on acid trips and sensations of universal truth in K-holes, but this was the most profound reality I had experienced yet. My whole existence was put into perspective, and I was being punished for wasting the gift of life. I blacked out at some point in the box and woke up in my friend's apartment the next day. He said I was out for about eight hours. The physical effects wore off about a day later, but the psychological impression has yet to fade. 
</p>
<p>
You know, I’ve been fucking around like that for a bit of time now. I’m not old yet, but it’s certainly been enough time for me to talk to younger people and say things like: <em>Yeah, I get where you’re coming from.</em> The fact is, most of life is a series of learning experiences. Only a very few of us get to do as much as we learn to do. Sort of like the difference between knowing how to do something, and just thinking you know how to do something: if the situation arises. This book is about a situation arising. These days, we spend more time learning and less time doing. It’s not a bad thing, per se. It’s just the times. 
</p>
<p>
I wanted to go to art school when I was younger, but I never did. I went to engineering school instead, when I finally did get to college. For a while I thought I wanted to theorize about making things, though later I realized I was much more of a maker. These are the kinds of things you think you know about yourself, but experience tells you otherwise. All of this is a long ways away from where we are now, in the narrative.
</p>
<p>
I never went to art school, but I did learn different ways to make art throughout my life. Or at least some ways to make an impression on a person or a group of people. It was always about an impression: convincing somebody, pulling it off. All of art is about this. Even the old stuff that’s at museums. The Renaissance especially. Anyway, regarding art: When I had artistic ambitions I was always trying to learn new strategies for making art. So of course I’d learn one strategy—from some historical conceptual art piece, let’s say—and I’d try it out immediately. It never worked. Instead of making art, I’d make stuff that could maybe pass as an art prop in a low-budget music video. The situations when you really put to use the things you’ve learned always come later, much later, after you’ve learned them. When the situation arises, you have to be ready with what you know. You have to remember all of the things you’ve learned at the right time. You’ve got to grasp the ring without falling off the horse.

“Datura is boundless, Datura is powerful beyond words,” I remember writing in my notebook.
</p>
<p>
Right then my friend Andy grabbed my shoulder and shoved a cordless telephone into my hand. This was 1998, so nobody had a cell phone or anything yet.

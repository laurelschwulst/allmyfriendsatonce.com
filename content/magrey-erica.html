One night in college, probably in 1997, my boyfriend and I stayed up for many intoxicated hours poring over cdnow.com. At the time, the site was incredibly novel—you could listen to samples of songs from CDs in order to preview them before purchase. Normally, if you weren’t able to borrow from a friend or your dad (ahem) or be on the receiving end of an awesome mix tape, you’d have to rely on other peoples’ opinions (record store clerks, reviewers) or just buy blindly. On CDnow it was easy to browse music because the site was among the first to suggest content based on what you were looking at. We freaked out over it and listened to many, many, MANY (short!) samples (I seem to remember Stereolab and Silver Apples among them) - so many that we reached the max allowable previews and were cut off by the site. If I recall correctly, the sample was always from the beginning of the song, meaning that you didn’t necessarily make it to the chorus, potentially missing out on the meat of the song. It’s funny now to think about us having reached a data cap, since for me, the Internet is characterized by this feeling of endless access. The trap is that you can click on content easily and endlessly (for better or for worse) - you never reach a dead end. I know the site was very successful and I can only imagine it played an important role in the dissemination of culture to people in more isolated communities (for which the WWW was so touted and beloved in the early days). It eventually got consumed by amazon, abruptly and with less functionality, to my total disappointment.

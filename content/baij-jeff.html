this was most likely the first screencap that i ever took, found it sitting on a cd-rom buried amongst highschool era mixes: my emo mix, my grindcore mix, my techno mix. the image still bears the original file name “speed,baby,speed.jpg”. clearly took this before i had any concept of file naming CONVENTIONS, i could never bring myself to put commas in a file name now. brian, one of my besties at the time, is “IWntUrBaby”; im “SinaGoGo”, and my highschool girlfriend is “lewd555”. these were only one of the tons and tons of screen names we each used. brian was the most flagrant of the many names-policy abusers, with something like 40 names/alter egos he switched between at complete random, sometimes mid sentence. he probably used some sort of script that he had built. brian was something of a hacker, but to be honest i dont actually know if thats true because at the time i had very little understanding of what the word “hacker” even meant. i know he could hand code html, that seemed close enough to “hacking” that i probably just assumed he was one. maybe a year before this picture was taken brian and i started what i guess you would call a net art site called Hyperbolic (ugh), modeled after the greats of the era (superbad.com, hell.com, JODI). it was hosted on tradewinds. no one remembers tradewinds but it was really cool, or at least i like to remember it as being really cool. maybe the geocities for people who knew what they were doing. i didnt know what i was doing, but brian did. basically i made the images and he coded the site. i remember one time i asked if we should make the splash page in flash, and he read it as “can we make the splash page flash” and from that day on the logo always blinked. i never corrected him. he used the blink tag, obviously. i also cant believe i suggested flash, such digital children. brian was completely fucking insane, his mother ran an old folks home out of his house, he lived in the basement (duh), and i once saw him snort a line of ants “because ozzy did it”. we went to different high schools so i only saw him in the evenings, which was probably for the best. one more fun thing about brian is that he never used the brakes in his car, he would just throw it into neutral, and after an especially heavy winter he would stop his car by driving into 4 foot high snowbanks. we are not friends on facebook, and the last i heard he was a marine.

this was the era of total AIM dominance, but i also had an ICQ account. ICQ was superior in many ways, including the feature where you could see your chat partner typing in real time (backspacing and all). people i think actually hated that concept, and others have tried it since, but it never takes off. some feel safer when they can edit unseen i guess. also ICQ didnt use screennames, instead opting for a phone number type of scheme. weird as hell. anyway AIM was great, there was a warn button that you could press and if you hit it enough times the other person couldnt chat for a few minutes. gchat desperately needs this feature. AIM was the first time i remember being truly introduced to the concept of an avatar (on AIM they called them icons i believe) and one could upload any appropriately sized image as their icon. no bullshit i did “brisk” business at a dollar a pop making these for classmates, i literally have a folder of hundreds of ones i made only for myself or my little brother. my fave was for a friend called jon doyle, it was a boob with the initials “JD” embossed into the skin. we used to call him “JD Watersports” and if you dont think thats hilarious than you need to lighten da hell up bruv. a final wonderful thing about AIM, and something that brian was a master of, was the ability to send chunks of html through chat that would do some sort of malicious shit to the receiver. things such as restarting their computer, freezing AIM, harmless but annoying stuff. the receiver had literally NO way to counteract this, if a person had your screenname they could pull tricks. it was a heady time.

anyway, 21kb/sec must have seemed like an outrageously fast speed for us at the time as witnessed by the barely visible snippets of conversation. these were obviously the days of dial-up, our family’s ISP of choice being “Erols Internet”. There is something charming about the family computer with an Internet Explorer icon renamed as the ISP we were using, and omg how adorable that the icon directly below is to disconnect from the web? remember when that was a choice you could actually make? an era where we all thought the internet was a place we visited and everything else was “IRL”. the fact that we thought that way but still RUSHED home from school to immediately sit in front of the computer and chat, as if we didnt have inklings that eventually the web would be our IRL, and everything outside of it was just the support system. so yeah, i can vaguely remember 32kb/sec being the very upper limit that we ever reached, but it would only last for seconds at a time. having the transfer speed stay at a solid 21kb/sec (“ITS CONSISTANT”) must have seemed like some sort of minor miracle. was it because it was 1:30am and no one else was really on the web that late (except highschoolers and frog people)? did the internet work that way back then, does it work that way now? i dont fuckin know. but let me tell you, we did A LOT of file transfers. there is a reason why the only two folders open are my music folder and my “received” folder. oh the received folder. my life at this time literally orbited this folder. everything that was sent to me through AIM ended up here, anything i wanted to send strangely enough was also in this folder. we spent a lot (read: all) of our time chatting with images, mp3s, wavs, whatever. tons and tons of swapping and editing files. i guess if you want to be corny it was a sort of personal precursor to something like dump.fm or 4chan or whatever. i dunno, even then i didnt spend any time on message boards or community oriented sites, that didnt happen until de.licio.us but thats for a whole other essay. anyhow, i still have this folder. its beautiful. its the acorn from which the mighty oak of my art practice was born. yep.

something super interesting about this picture is also how it was taken at pretty much at the exact same moment that napster began to catch on, edging out shitty ftp and irc methods of gathering music. at the time those were the only ways to steal music (besides of course the one to one AIM transfer that is the sorta-subject of this essay). ftp was especially horrible, because you had to upload a certain amount of MBs before you could download a certain amount of MBs (the almighty ratio). like if you wanted an album it would probably be around 70mb, so you had to upload like 30 mb to get enough “credit” to download 70mb, and when you are talking about upload speeds of 6kb a second its just not worth it. oh right and you couldnt upload something they already on their computer. shit took so long you might as well have just walked to the local sam goody at the mall and racked a bunch of PHYSICAL cds. napster was literally a godsend. seriously, more than anything it revolutionized not music sharing, but ALBUM downloading, as opposed to just downloading singles. ok so i have both winamp and my music folder open, which tells me i was probably dropping songs into winamp one by one. this was before i really understood the concept of a playlist, or randomizing, which is funny because randomizing has since become the only way i listen to music, and to think of my 16 year old self selecting songs and pulling them into winamp individually is mindblowing. i would  kill to see what song was currently playing at the moment this picture was taken, but alas. winamp was very special, and even tho itunes ended being a gamechanger (for a lot of people anyway), winamp just was out of this world. it was so easy to make your own skins or themes or whatever, and their library of user-made visualizations was vast and so so trippy. i mean its really important to understand that there was NOTHING before winamp. nothing. between winamp and napster those suits at the record companies man, they really lost their caviar. once again, heady heady times.

finally, a list of things in this image that i wont elaborate on but should be mentioned:
<ul>
	<li>635 mb remaining on the hard drive (lol)</li>
	<li>a separate icon for my mom to log into her work email (lol)</li>
	<li>the shortcut icons being in THEIR OWN FOLDER CALLED “SHORTCUTS” (LOL)</li>
	<li>something called “network neighborhood” that i saw every day for years but never ever clicked</li>
</ul>

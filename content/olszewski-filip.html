before mailing out cds to everyone in the world, AOL used to bundle them with magazines like PC Gamer. and years before i first saw the claim of 90 free hours i had already tried to hook my older brother’s Commodore 64 up to a mysterious network called PULSE. i was around 8 and had no clue what i was doing but decided hours of + signs slowly filling the screen most likely meant the connection was unsuccessful. it wasn’t until Windows 3.11’s bundled telephone program that i was able to hook my Compaq up to the phone lines for networking fun like making calls using the computer microphone. it must have been these experiences that allowed me to know pretty much exactly what to do once i had the AOL cd in my hands around 1995.

it’s hard to write about all this without feeling like i am bragging. i suppose it just baffles me a bit as to what my motivation was to get on the internet at such an early age. My parents had enough of a hard time learning to speak english to have any interest in technology. my brother was ten years older than me and had a very different life. i can’t remember a single friend with internet at the time. my only guess is that the potential for accessing more beyond my own computer without the need for begging to be taken to Nobody Beats the Wiz was appealing. once connected though, i was too confused to really do anything. it seemed like the whole thing was just references to spiders and i didn’t get it. chat rooms scared me surprisingly as much as all other forms of social interaction. the AOL member’s art section was cool though. i loved uploading my rollerblading MS Paint drawings and imagining all the people who could see them.

it was probably music that helped me truly begin to appreciate the internet. i was very into Nirvana and addicted to the feeling of intense immobilizing depression their songs made me feel. we were relatively poor and i didn’t understand the concept of buying cds, so all i had was my brothers copy of Nevermind. i would spend entire weekends sitting at the computer with it on loop while drawing Mortal Kombat logos and waiting for 20 second clips of other Nirvana songs to download. this was before MP3s so 11MB WAV files of nothing but the chorus of Heart Shaped Box were my only option- but that of course is not entirely true. there was also MIDI.  the unique thing about files in the .mid or .midi formats is that they are very small in size since they contain zero sound of their own, instead they provide instructions for a device to generate the audio using it’s built in instrument soundbanks. for a long time i did not like MIDI files. i constantly felt tricked by them. thinking i had finally found a 34KB version of an entire song, only to be disappointed by the sound of a flute instead of Kurt. nevertheless i collected the MIDIs and spent a lot of time listening to them before getting into buying cds. my folders featured mostly Nirvana, Green Day, Marilyn Manson, NIN - though the file i remember most vividly was Bullet with Butterfly Wings by Smashing Pumpkins.

while a considerable number of websites used MIDI files for background music, there were 3 primary types that hosted them for download. the ones i spent the most time on were band fansites. they had excellent collections of handpicked MIDIs specific to a single band. very often these sites were part of webrings. near the bottom of the page there would be a cool image declaring membership of “Beeswax: The Nirvana Webring” for instance, along with “next” and “previous” buttons linking you to other Nirvana fansites. this was one of my favorite methods for finding new sites as there was always the possibility of bigger and better collections around the corner. when searching by song rather than by band one might have found themselves on giant MIDI archives. they would have musicians listed a-z with anywhere from one to a couple dozen carelessly gathered MIDIs for a particular artist. often the files were poorly made or mislabeled. nevertheless these sites became more and more prominent (since they were monetizable) and were a nice way of hearing new music. the third and most elusive websites were those run by the actual MIDI makers. these were of medium size, usually consisting of a variety of bands and artists - presumably ones that the person sequencing the files was interested in. despite possibly being the sources of MIDI files on the internet these sites were quickly overshadowed by the other two categories. the only time i’d stumble upon one was when searching Lycos or Altavista for the filename of a MIDI, then going through webpages that hosted that exact file.

looking back on all this now, it’s such an interesting usage of MIDI, which as a format was created for something quite different. manufacturers made a brilliant move by incorporating a General MIDI compatible 128 instrument bank into personal computers. and internet users were brilliant for utilizing that functionality as an early means of successfully sharing music over 14.4k connections. who were these individuals who spent hours recreating popular and unpopular songs in order to share with others? these beautiful files. these amazing works of translation. am i projecting good intentions and generosity on a model which people in reality were making money off? were MIDIs made for other purposes (such as karaoke) and their presence on the internet was merely a second life? it may have been a combination of things, but the truth in this case doesn’t really matter. what matters is that the internet felt full of generosity, curiosity, problem solving, consideration, slowness and it’s these qualities i try to hold in my heart while making artwork and not only while making artwork.

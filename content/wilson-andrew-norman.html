In 1988 at the Kodak Headquarters in Rochester, New York, father led me into a server room to show me the new IBM AS/400. I writhed a bit as we passed through the doorway, accidentally knocking the coffee mug out of his hand, onto the floor, and into pieces. He placed me on the server, away from the spill, and called in a janitor.

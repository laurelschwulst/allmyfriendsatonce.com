My cousin and I were around 9 years old. Every summer we would spend a week together at my grandparent’s home in Santa Monica. There was an old PC (you know the kind with the yellowed monitor casing) upstairs that we would spend all night on, traveling through AOL sex chat rooms and playing Drugwars. My grandparents were fast asleep downstairs with the television blaring some old movie like Gone with the Wind or something with Barbra Streisand.

Lauren was a bit more sexually mature than I was. My mother still reminds me of how she would flirt with the lifeguards by the public pools when she was only four. So the online chatting was definitely prompted by her. I was more of a passive participant, reading and learning.

The internet was a big part of my sexual education -- things like sword fighting, salad tossing and fisting. Pics were never shared at the time, or when they were we would promptly log off -- mostly out of fear, for images at that point seemed more real and taboo than text. Perhaps this was why later on, in middle school, I preferred reading erotic fiction over watching porn.

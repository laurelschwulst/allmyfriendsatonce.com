My AOL Instant Messenger screenname was Proflirt223.
</p>
<p>
I used the internet solely to contact boys or to perv out in chatrooms and, by the 8th grade, the online conversations I had about touching myself and others were turning into IRL experiences. 
</p>
<p>
There were two boys, Alex and Charles, who I IM’d a lot. We had become friends to survive the intensity of navigating the middle school hierarchies of cool. We were all pretty lame. Lame in different ways but lame. 
</p>
<p>
One night they messaged me to come over. Another girl was there but I forget her name.
</p>
<p>
We drank Alex’s parent’s alcohol, got naked in the attic and ended up … um.. having an orgy. Orgy is not the right word but we came as close to fucking as you can get with two prepubescent boys who, I’m pretty sure had never cum before in their lives. 
</p>
<p>
A few hours later, only a little tipsy, my mom picked me up. As soon as I got home I logged into the family computer to chat with Alex and Charles. 
</p>
<p>
I remember messaging,<br />
“Did it taste like fish? (lol).” 
</p>
<p>
We messaged for a while.  I described what their dicks were like in my mouth and what it was like to have them eat me out. At some point I got tired and went to bed.
</p>
<p>
The next morning I was eating breakfast when I was handed a print out of my AIM chat from the night before. I don’t think I will ever forget the shame and mortification I felt as I had to read all of my chats out loud to my parents over a bowl of cereal. 
 </p>
<p>
—Did this really happen?
</p>
<p>
—Yes. 
</p>
<p>
—Was leaving my chat open a cry for help? 
</p>
<p>
—No. I was just drunk. 
</p>
<p>
—Was that a cry for help? 
</p>
<p>
—...Maybe.

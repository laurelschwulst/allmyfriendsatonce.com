<h2>The Clockwork Orange Tamagotchi Friend Thing</h2>

My new best friend in 5th Grade, Joey Berlusconi, came over to my house because I had 28.8kbps dial-up and he only had 14.4kbps. He said that it wasn’t really a house though. He lived in a house; I didn’t. It was true, I had just moved out of a real house into a two-family unit with my mom. My parents got a divorce a few months earlier. My mom was sleeping on the couch in the house and that was weird. This two-family unit was better because it meant she could sleep in a bed again, even if it was alone. Joey’s parents were together and he still had a happy family. But I had a faster connection to AOL, so that’s why he came over. 
</p>

We went to my home after school. I asked him to take this slightly longer way, so we could pass by the house of a girl I liked named Deanna. I hoped she would be standing outside on the lawn and we could talk for a second. Later that year, I would spend a lot of time at her house; it was really emotional, but that’s another story. So, when we got to my home, I wanted to show Joey this movie trailer I saw last night. It was for a movie I really liked that I watched over the summer called A Clockwork Orange. I borrowed the tape from the library probably 25 times during the vacation between 4th and 5th grade and thought it was the weirdest movie; so smart and cool. I felt really badass watching it because I knew a lot of the stuff in it was “evil.” 
</p>
<p>
The night before, I was using AOL to search for stuff about this beloved evil film. I found a trailer and thought it was so interesting and nice that someone out there had this clip and made a website to put it on the web. I kept wondering how he got the 35mm film onto the computer. I had heard about things like a TargaCard for video editing and I knew it was really expensive, so the guy must be rich and probably also a nerd. 
</p>
<p>
Watching the trailer the night before on the computer felt even more evil than watching the movie. First off, it was on the computer and the computer monitor is so small and bright and a little curved and that feels evil. And the light was off and my mom was asleep in bed. Also it took about three hours to download the clip so I could watch it on this website for movie trailers. Anytime you’re waiting for something for three hours at night your mind goes to an evil place. After 10 minutes only about 3 seconds had been downloaded and I played them over and over. I played the whole thing over and over while it downloaded and I still know it by heart to this day (almost the year 2047).
</p>
<p>
If you’ve seen the trailer you know it is edited together super fast with classical music and has words like “sardonic” fill the whole screen and also the main character’s eyes are like clamped open wide. Sometimes classical music can feel even more evil than rap and metal music, and this time it did. Now if you have any taste you can understand why I was pumped to show this to my new best friend, Joey. Especially because one time we were walking to his house and he tried to hit a cat with some rocks, so I know he has a little bit of evil in him. 
</p>
<p>
But when we got to my home it actually turned out to be a big disappointment. I thought, because I waited for it to download on the trailers page the night before, it would be waiting there for me or just download really quickly, but that didn’t happen. Oh no, now we would have to wait for another three hours. At Joey’s house this would be okay because he had a cool TV and Yoo-hoo and a dog and backyard (although it would take 6 hours there because he only had 14.4kbps speed). But because we’d just moved into this new place with no backyard, we didn’t get a TV yet and also my mom hated all pets and cabinet snacks. Joey was pissed that there was no Yoo-hoo and if I was him I would be too. 
</p>
<p>
My mom came home from work around 530pm and she had a bad attitude about American kids. She thought they were spoiled, stupid and a bad influence. Deep down inside I knew she was right, but they were also a lot cooler than her, so whatever. This was my internal conflict for most of my adolescent and pubescent years. The trailer was about 35 seconds downloaded and Joey had watched it with me several times. My mom asked us if we had done our homework and Joey said he had to leave. I asked him to stay until it finished. He asked me if it got different at the end and I said no it was just like this the whole way through. Then he said he wanted to shoot basketball before it got too dark out. I told him bye. My mom looked at him like he was a little piece of shit as he left our home and then asked me if I was hungry. I wish she had asked him too.
</p>
<p>
The next day Joey was pretty normal to me at school. This made me really relieved and I realized that’s what it means to have a best friend: someone who doesn’t give a shit about your mom. From now on we would just hang out at Joey’s house. And there we were, a few months later, closer than ever, drinking Yoo-hoos and watching TV. As we flipped through the channels, we felt a bit too old for cartoons or Power Rangers, so sometimes we watched movies or shitty daytime sports like Bowling or Women’s 8-Ball. 
</p>
<p>
On this particular day we were watching an interview with the Spice Girls on Oprah. Everyone knew the Spice Girls were hot, even if their music made no sense (I’m nearly 62yo and still don’t know what “zigga-zig-ah” is!) and Oprah is kinda for American moms, but also if you were pretty mature you could get into what they were talking about too. So we were watching this in-depth interview and Posh was turning me on, then Baby, and I was about to ask Joey who he thought the hottest one was when I looked over and saw he wasn’t staring at their faces, hair, breasts or even at Oprah when she asked the questions. Instead he was playing with a toy that was on a keychain. It was pink and he was pressing buttons on it like on a Gamegear. I said what game is that and he told me it wasn’t a game but a Tamagotchi. I asked him to elaborate further and he told me it’s like a little Japanese computer baby that you have to take care of; feed it and give it attention and it’ll survive, but if you mess up and ignore it, it fucking dies and then you just have a worthless piece of shit piece of plastic. I had heard about this before and thought it was only for girls. I told him that it was only for girls and that he was gay for being into it. He told me to shutup. I told him you already have an awesome Jack Russell Terrier (like the dog in the movie The Mask, which Joey and I saw together, and also the literature dog on PBS called Wishbone, which I often watched, never with Joey), why do you want a fake computer pet, but he didn’t say anything. I grabbed another Yoo-hoo from his fridge and then came back and stood above him watching him feed the Tamagotchi for a while. This was even more boring than watching my other friend Tommy play one-player video games and it hurt my neck more. I asked Joey if he wanted to play basketball and he said not really, prob because I sucked at it, but also because he had to feed his robot. 
</p>
<p>
The next few days at school, I saw Joey whip out the Tamagotchi in class and get in trouble with teachers. When we walked to his house from school he sometimes didn’t look where he was going and one time even tripped, all because he was balls deep into taking care of that fake baby. It became less and less fun hanging out with him. I tried to snap him out of it, by starting a fight with him, but that just made him cry and I felt bad. Usually he was the one that made me cry; what the hell was going on here?!  This Tamagotchi was really changing him.
</p>
<p>
Then one day we got to his house from school and his Jack Russell Terrier had sprayed diarrhea dog shit all over everything in the house. He looked at me really desperate and hurt, like one of the starving children in the commercials they make about those kids. He called the Wishbone-clone over and it came to him squealing, diarrhea dripping from its backside. I looked at the house with fingers pinching my nose and literally, the whole place looked like ten gallons of Yoo-hoo had exploded everywhere. Oh my god we have to clean this up, it smells so bad, he complained. Sorry, I can’t...I really have to go home, I explained. He asked me to clarify that I wasn’t going to help. I told him, that’s right, I had to go.
</p>
<p>
At that point we officially stopped being best friends, but I guess it’d been a long time coming. Anyway, I was getting really into coming straight home from school and going into AOL chatrooms. It was so cool to talk to people who I would never get to meet because they were really far away. I loved abbreviations like “ASL” and the way you could just say whatever the fuck you motherfucking wanted to and no one would really care. Sometimes I’d even do it for so long that I missed new episodes of Wishbone. 
</p>
<p>
Eventually, I started using my screenname to talk to people that I knew from school. People that I didn’t even really talk to at school, I ended up talking to a lot through our screennames. Most of the time it was girls that I had crushes on. It was a lot more of a steady payoff than trying to walk home past Deanna’s lawn and hoping she’d be there to talk. Anyway, when I added her to my buddy list I found out she never was going to be out on the lawn anyway, because she was always inside on her AOL too. At the beginning I had close to 25 friends online to choose from; by the end of the 5th grade I had over 100 in my buddy list. I talked to them so much and so smart and so emotional through our screennames and they really got to see how crazy and funny and awesome my mind worked. The real me. One person I never talked to through our screennames was Joey, probably because he was too busy with his fucking Tamagotchi.

More than 50 years later, I’m still kicking and I guess I’m still exactly the same. The blip implanted into my amygdala helps to diminish my fervent expectations and mediate access to the GRATI membranes, so I’m not blinking more than four times in a row when I see or read about someone I want to fall in love with. It’s a very cool idea to invent that sort of control and maybe even a little bit “sardonic.” Last I heard of Joey was 49 years ago, when his family moved to a different town. No wait, he tried to friend me on Facebook 31 years ago, but I had already reached my 12,000 friend limit. Now I kind of wish I had deleted some other people and confirmed him, but whatever, NBD.

When I was 13 my friends and I were obsessed with Everquest. I played as a gnome magician I called Cazik. He appeared as a 3-foot-tall balding elderly man. I named Cazik after the Everquest NPC and deity, Cazic-Thule, the faceless god of fear. My friends played as Kevlar, the half-elf ranger, and Nugbit, the gnome warrior.

<p>
Soon after we started playing, we found ourselves meeting online more frequently than in person. But even when we met IRL our conversations usually still revolved around Everquest. A common topic was that we didn’t actually enjoy playing Everquest, but felt an insatiable compulsion to sink time into the game. We talked about how Everquest was designed in a way that made it difficult to want to log out, because you always felt like you were about to accomplish something significant, whether it was getting money, a new spell, or leveling up.

At the time, we didn’t realize how profound the phenomenon we were experiencing would become in the gaming industry. We were tapping into a discussion on the early tactics of game developers to facilitate gaming addictions by baiting players with prizes. Since the increase in popularity of MMORPGs over the last 20 years, these same tactics have become a focus of criticism of game developers.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, our addictions to Everquest were mild compared to many hardcore players, and I eventually hit a wall and refused to go further. Because of the way the game is designed, when your character reaches a certain level you must invest significantly more time and energy if you want to level your character any higher. I could foresee a point in which Everquest would no longer be a hobby and would become an entire lifestyle.

It was a difficult choice to stop playing, because there was still so much of Norrath (The World of Everquest) that I’d yet to explore. I would occasionally log on and dilly dally around the city of Qeynos or Freeport just to explore, but I never had the energy to level Cazic further. I continued to pay the $9.89 a month to keep my account active so that my characters wouldn’t be deleted.
</p>
<p>
Then one day something happened that made the choice to quit much easier. After not playing for several weeks I decided to log on and take a stroll through the dark elve’s Nektulos Forest. Suddenly I was approached by a half-elf bard. He revealed that he was an in-game moderator, and said that he’d been meaning to contact me for the better part of a year. Apparently since Cazik’s name was similar to Cazic-Thule’s, it had to be changed immediately. The bard gave me the option of thinking of a new name on the spot, but I’m notoriously bad at creating character names and couldn’t come up with anything. Then, without a moment’s notice, the moderator abruptly decided to forever change Cazik’s name to Cathic.
</p>
<p>
I was enraged and felt disconnected from Everquest and my character. I had nearly two years of emotional investment in Cazik, and friends knew me by that name online. This new development felt like a sign that couldn’t be denied; my time in Norrath had come to an abrupt end. I continued paying the monthly fee for several months afterwards, and I hoped that I’d return one day. But it turned out to be the last time I ever logged into Everquest.

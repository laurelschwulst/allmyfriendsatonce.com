So what the fuck, why is it that pretty much the only thing I remember about being on the internet as a young teenager (like I guess I was a tween, but there was no such thing back then, I was probably just a twelve year old. I actually don’t know what age tweens are, but I’m guessing ten years old to twelve years old is pretty tweeny*), the only thing I vividly remember about being on the internet was my go-to pornographic content - just a single image, not a site full of categories and content that could satisfy most any statistically significant fetish, but like one picture: Of a dark-haired, sultry (slutty)-looking asian woman, all naked but for long black-and-white socks, on her knees, taking a giant glossy white dildo in her glistening wet pussy.

She really looked like she was into sitting on this thing.

This was probably around the time of the transition from 28.8 to 56k modems - my father was an early adopter of internet technology; we had an atari 400 and 800, which sound more lame, or less impressive than the 2600 which was the popular cartridge-fed game console made by Atari, but these were real computers. My father would spend time on bulletin boards downloading hundreds of video games onto six inch floppies, so I had access to all sorts of 8-bit titles, some popular ones like ‘Spy Hunter’, ‘Mario Bros’, and ‘Lode Runner’, but also more obscure games like ‘Blue Max’ (A 3/4 perspective WWI fighter plane simulator/action adventure) and ‘Hover Bovver’ (A time-based competitive birds-eye view lawn-mowing contest). I knew these games came to us digitally and were not bought at the store, that they were retrieved through other computers somewhere else, through the telephone? I don’t know if my dad was using a 14.4 modem or something even more primitive to acquire them, but I never got online using these Atari computers - by the time I was introduced to the internet my father had purchased an Amiga, which was set up downstairs in his office, and the Ataris were disconnected from the telephone and moved upstairs to the room I shared with my brother.

So I’d go downstairs and I’d dial up the internet, and I’d get on whatever browser it was my father had installed on the Amiga, Mosaic I think, or Netscape Navigator, and I’d search for ‘xxx fuck “sex”’ or whatever it was that led me to the link for this picture… on Webcrawler… and depending on the integrity of the connection, the image would load and appear, at a slow downward scroll, sometimes very slowly, sometimes excruciatingly slow: First the eyes, which were shut, not so exciting; then the lips - cherry red, emotionally-charged, a mix of (a little) pain and (mostly) ecstasy; then the tits, nice (pretty big); the mid-riff, belly pierced… then that juicy, hairy pussy, with this enormous white dildo almost balls-deep inside it, wow; then finally these unbelievable, amazonian thighs, covered to the knees with striped socks, they completed the picture.
</p>
<p>
Holy shit I couldn’t believe this woman’s vagina was capable of swallowing such an enormous object.

I guess this was some of the more graphic content I had access to - I do remember also searching for naked pictures of celebrities - Alissa Milano, Teri Hatcher; but those were just like topless shots. There were Playboys in the house, and I had a Penthouse or two; I’d seen Club Confidential, but even that one, Club Confidential, which was the raunchiest of the bunch I’d seen, was still unable to show any penetration, no dicks were allowed in pussies… so I guess that’s why this image, when I came across it, with this asian woman captured in the act of actually getting fucked by something, or I guess she was doing the fucking… seeing the woman in the act was what was so engaging, and why I was willing to wait for its arrival on many occasions.

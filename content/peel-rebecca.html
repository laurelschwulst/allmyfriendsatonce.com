I just logged back into my photobucket account for the first time since 2008. I created it in 2004. Most of my nude photos are gone now, which bores me; did I remove them?
</p>
<p>
I didn’t share them with very many people, but I had to put them somewhere other than my parents’ hard drive. I was upbraided because ‘Rebecca I know that art can be lots of different things but I hope you know that the internet is a dangerous place. I hope that you’re not sharing these on the internet.’ Only with a few people!
</p>
<p>
Well they’re gone now but logging back in I remembered that it was kind of a private purgatory for my images – not my parents’ hard drive and not hi5.  I could try out how the internet felt on my private photos before I showed them to people – and from what I remembered I left them because it felt erotic, still. Just to have them there.

Logging back in I couldn’t find them but my photobucket wasn’t empty. I did have photos in there, some were designs I’d made to use as backgrounds on my early websites and a couple were drawings that never turned into tattoos or photos of people I had crushes on, but most of the remaining photos were of a friend who had passed away in 2007.  He was 20 years old. We weren’t that close necessarily but he was going to be an astronaut. And he was a mathematician. And a filmmaker. I liked his spirit and I guess I thought I needed to save these photos.

One time in 2009 I went to his facebook page and as soon as I landed there my computer crashed and displayed a strange message I’d never seen.  Of course I thought maybe he’d done it or something, like I dunno, he was sending a message. Back then everything was a sign. His profile still exists but his profile picture is gone.

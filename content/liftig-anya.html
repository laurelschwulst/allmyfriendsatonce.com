In the fall of 1991 I was a tiny freshman in a slick high school in Connecticut. It was a place where you “popped your collar” or else. By either misfortune or good luck, I was placed in French 100 Honors where our teacher started the first class by explaining why he would never actually be speaking French throughout the year. “You see, I have a terrible American accent and I don’t want you to pick it up. So we will spend the year watching the French in Action video tape series.”  And ever true to his word, each day I spent fifty minutes watching the scintillating Mireille roam through the streets of Paris with her dorky side kick, Robert.  I learned the essential French terms for “bicycle handles” “protractor” and “You stinking filthy cop!”  (The later actually came in handy years later during a Parisian “manifestation.”) I slogged my way through endless quizzes and tests pulled right out of the back of a grease-encrusted textbook. But mostly, I learned about Internet porn.

Jack Hand (his real name, so sue me) and Brian Diviney sat directly behind me. I endured the endless spitballs tossed into my long hair and the occasional spell of heavy breathing. They whispered, “You smell!” over and over—going so far as to bring in a bar of Speed Stick and smear it all over my desk. They taunted me with tales of serial killers eating their female prey, reminding each other to “not forget the barbeque sauce” when my time came. One afternoon, already notable for the fact that our bumbling teacher’s fly was fully unzipped, Jack and Brian discovered a new trick. Over my right shoulder sailed a piece of printer paper with the long side perforations of an early Epson still attached.

I looked at the image. It seemed to be a rug, no; it was a map of some sort. Wait, there was a limb, on top of another limb, and was that a sailor suit?  I turned it on its side, now it was a poorly printed Winslow Homer painting, or a scattergram of data, strangely shaped data. I flipped it again and out of those swollen pixilated squares emerged something new. Something I had heretofore never imagined, I can only compare it to the first time I was skunk drunk and discovered, I mean truly discovered, how comfortable the concrete of a suburban driveway could be. From behind me, Jack panted, “69…..Sixty-nine….Liftig! Sixty-nine.”

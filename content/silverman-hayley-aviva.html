When I was seventeen I was a member of the Latin Dynasty Dimes, a Mexican girl-gang in suburban New Jersey. I am not Mexican but no one really cared. My friend Anai was the leader but went by Scarlett online. My alias had changed a few times but plateaued at aviva13. The gang was my ambient companion--  we spent most of our time listening to music, driving, and sitting in other gang members parents living rooms. Girls legs met clear plastic vinyl that revealed clouded textiles. On the weekends I would visit Anai in the mall where she worked at a freestanding booth that sold miniature teddy-bears. One day I remember logging online to update my AOL profile page that said at the top: SUP TO ALL MY SEÑORITAS…It was a disappointing shout-out. The overall momentum of the page was deflated by its lay-out: the inhabitants were all unlinked names with crude descriptors in italics. There were stock images of hot air balloons. Months later, another link appeared in my inbox. I opened it to see a AOL homepage for our gang. There were beauty shots of Anai and Zuele and Patricia, mine was a candid in which I looked spooked. Underneath each face was a cloud of animated glitter with our names in cursive pulsating. It felt really great to leave it open.

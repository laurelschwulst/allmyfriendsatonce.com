<h2>Remembering my Time with a Counter-Strike Clan</h2>
<div class="byline">Nicholas O'Brien</div>

One of the crowning achievements of my high school years was being asked to join a clan on Counter-Strike. Clans were a type of online gaming group that you played and trained with to compete with other clans around the world. I always liked the term.  It seemed a bit more based in a familial bond than teams – coming together more in the spirit of collaboration rather than competition. 
</p>
<p>
This was in the late 90s, when the Internet connection at my parent’s house was getting stable enough to maintain consistent modem connectivity. My parents had also just decided to relocate the family Hewlett-Packard - or Gateway, I can’t remember - to a more convenient location close to my basement bedroom. These combined events made for a lot of late nights tying up the phone line with counter-terrorist bomb defusal.
</p>
<p>
I wasn’t a particularly talented player—I tended to try and rush important control points more than I tried to snipe or be defensive—but I quickly learned the important techniques of crouch jumping around a corner, short bursts with automatic rifles, and quick weapon switching to avoid reloading in a firefight. A big trick was learning how to avoid single-shot kills from AWPers on maps like de_inferno, where snipers would be hiding around impossible angles to scope you from across the map. But of course, I also quickly learned to criticize such tactics as the play-style of unskilled and lucky “campers.”
</p>
<p>
On nights when I wasn’t playing well, I’d always blame my “laggy” (or slow) connection. Most of my opponents were already in college, or could afford newly introduced DSL connections, so for them it was obvious when my ping would bring down a server. As a result I would usually be one of the first of my teammates to die, but when my connection was more consistent I would frequently be within the top 5 in kill-count. Even though I can’t pinpoint my skills in retrospect, I suppose there was some underlying logic to my style of play and I soon became better at staying alive.
</p>
<p>
I was “whispered” to once in-game; a stranger asked me if I was interested in joining a clan. I said that I was – even if I knew very little what that actually meant - and we exchanged AIM account information so that we could chat after our current match. When he pinged me, he told me he was recruiting new clan members and offered me a chance to join a private server for a scheduled initiation match occurring that weekend against a rival clan. I told him I’d be there, and when the night came a clear dial-up favored my ability to perform well enough to earn me a spot within their ranks. 
</p>
<p>
This meant that now I had a specific title: a noticeable, in-bracket, all-caps, three-letter abbreviation for our clan that would serve a prefix to my username. Although I can’t remember what our call-sign was, I do remember that it meant that  I possessed enough skill to be considered worthy of such a title. It was like a badge of belonging to some exclusive club. In some ways this new title made me exuberantly proud, but at other times I realized that it also came with a somewhat unexpected burden. 
</p>
<p>
When bearing this title, I had to constantly represent my clan, in every match, and even when I just wanted to play casually. When my stats would periodically drop, it not only reflected on my own personal skill level, but also the reputability of my clan. Often times smack-talk would come from fellow clan members through suggestions that my play was not on par with the rest of my teammates. I tended to shrug this off and remained in my dutiful role for several matches and semiweekly team rehearsals, eventually becoming a recruiter for other potential clanmates. I even made us a clan website using Tripod.com; it contained screenshots, rankings, profile pages, and frequent hand-coded updates that taunted players in upcoming matches. Within a year, however, the amount of attention I was putting into the clan detracted from my schoolwork. My parents also took notice of the CRT glow and rapid clicking that came from the basement well past midnight almost every night.
</p>
<p>
I broke the news to my clan mid-practice one evening, saying that if I continued to play this much my parents would kill me. None of them realized that I was still a teenager, and most agreed that my grades were more important than my CS world-rank. Thus ending my clan-days.
</p>
<p>
From time to time I’d get on and play casually, and once or twice I was approached to join another team, but respectfully declined. I kept in touch with the guy who recruited me over AIM, and even remember once talking to him over the phone. He sounded a lot older, and I almost immediately could tell that he wasn’t someone I’d actually like to get to know in person. He talked a lot about his favorite headshots from the last round of matches, new prospective clan-mates, new community maps that he enjoyed, or how much he hated college. I suppose I knew that we actually had nothing in common besides the clan. Shortly thereafter we stopped communication, and after a couple of months I took down the clan website. It hadn’t been updated in a long time, and since no one seemed to complain or care, I deduced that the clan - which at one point seemed so central to my life - had long ago disbanded.

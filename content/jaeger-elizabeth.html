My first experiences on the Internet were also sadly my first ventures into true juvenescence. As a child I had cried profusely when my entire family died on the Oregon Trail to at a later age became obsessed with the more reliable game of the Sims and my character’s real estate ventures. As kids, we were hungry and there was always a game that pleased our curiosity and our parent’s educational considerations. 
</p>
<p>
As a tween, the Internet became standard at home, and my generation ditched the expensive store bought games to eagerly anticipate night after night the last chime of the AOL dial up. The excitement of the possibility of private conversations with the opposite sex satisfied our desires for the unknown far more than the next level of 007.  
</p>
<p>
Whereas my appearance changed drastically during that transition, at 13 I was still using a Windows94 PC I had doodled on and the desk I had carved faces into with a ballpoint pen. My computer was still placed directly next to the television to preserve a semblance of family togetherness, and my webcam documented many of my poor hair cut decisions as well as my parents sitting on the couch behind me watching Seinfeld.
</p>
<p>
Despite the many typing classes I had been forced to take in elementary, the first time I learned to type quickly was by chatting with friends from my middle school, and their friends of friends of friends of friends. I can remember all of maybe four conversations from that time: Three were with each of my three (simultaneous) “boyfriends.”
</p>

<p>
The other was with an A/S/L that said they wanted to kill me.
</p>
<p>
This potential murderer knew a lot of my information. They said they’d found me via Kevin, a 13 year old boy I never hung out with IRL but chatted with often. Early in our conversation, they asked me if I was a Blood or a Crip.  I didn’t really get the implications but when they asked if I wore red I said YES thinking it was tough, and crap they wore blue and I was dead. They knew where I lived and promised a drive by I should be really fucking scared.
</p>
<p>
I quickly blocked them.  
</p>
<p>
The Internet was strange and I pondered my preteen possibilities. I may have played cool, but oddly enough the same week they vowed to kill me my middle school held an assembly warning about violence in chat rooms. Kids had been found they vouched, and murdered. 
</p>
<p>
Printer ready, paper in, I found my chat history, and handed a copy to my principal. Telling my peers it was purely revenge, I knew I was a little scared and definitely curious to see what would happen if I reported that I was a potential victim to my hippie private French school. They were predominately discreet about their actions and assured me I had done the right thing. 
</p>
<p>
Nothing more came of it and the potential murderer drifted into the World Wide Web. I continued using my graffitied workstation, won the battle to move it into my bedroom and negotiated many of my biggest adolescent moments over AIM. (Myspace profiles pics, prolonged breakups, and even where I would sneak off to lose my virginity.) 
</p>
<p>
The potential murderer only came up again when I was 16 and had an Acura Integra. My two best friends, Jessie, who I grew up with, and Greta, whom Jessie and I met on the Lyon Street Steps, would drive around together to different parks in San Francisco. We would sit in a dark in a playground or sometimes in the bushes, and freeze in our current fashions to drink 40s and smoke weed with graduates. We had fake IDs and went to the 3 places we knew would let us in – all in neighborhoods we were told never to visit. A young boy our age had recently been murdered for wearing red, his school color, while smoking a cigarette outside of a bar we knew the name of. Over tea in a crowded café I mentioned my unsolved case to my two besties - decidedly leaving out the principal and the print out. They had threatened to drive by me because I wore red, I divulged. 
</p>
<p>
While I could tell Jessie definitely remembered our school becoming involved and was deliberating whether to mention it, Greta exclaimed “it was me – we were kidding– you got me in such deep shit.” The potential wave of embarrassment was replaced by a tsunami. 
</p>
<p>
As it turned out, Greta had gone to middle school with Kevin, and as a joke he had urged her and her cousin to AIM me. Her cousin had done most of the typing. After I handed in the print out, my school had apparently tracked her down to her school and Greta was suspended, almost expelled. 
</p>
<p>
Unbeknownst to me, her mother had called my mother to apologize that Greta had used the “M” word (murder) and explained that she was really a nice kid –  my mother had never accepted and went as far as to force Greta to call as well. My perceived dial up ventures into mystery and independence were revealed to have only been just highly monitored and close range socializing. 
</p>
<p>
After our initial shock, the chat seemed so far removed that it never really affected Greta and I’s friendship. We continued to drive around in the Integra and found a few new places to use our fake IDs. IRL Greta never claimed the identity of the potential murderer in my mind, nor in my mother’s when she called me to pick her up on the house phone. These two worlds of Internet tweendom and four-wheeled adolescence thankfully remained distinct. 
</p>
<p>
Every couple years I find myself nostalgic for that naivety and search for the chat histories; only to continually realize that every account is still expired from disuse - its contents archived somewhere I have yet to find.

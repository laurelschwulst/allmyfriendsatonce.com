When I was in high school (class of 2004 whazzap), one of the kids in our friend circle had a pretty advanced computer setup; 3 interconnected monitors, a graphics system seemingly always in a flux-state of constant upgrading...this thing was built for nerding out on an extreme level. Most importantly though was the combination of a high-speed internet connection and his bedroom being far enough away from his parents to allow for unfettered, all night, mind destroying net romps. Of course, rather than tap into the expansive, cobbled together network of a pre-Web 2.0 landscape to find info on Byzantine casket engraving, we looked for nothing more than the worst, most perverse, consistently hilarious content we could find.

Now, I don’t think this is all that much of an anomaly; I’m certainly not boasting about staying inside, not making out with girls. Most kids navigating the fallout of the post-puberty mindset push the limits of what they are told to do and challenge what is deemed ‘appropriate’ by their parents/guardians. Underage drinking, bumbling hook-ups and bong rips are the stuff of the reality show that is high-school. Instead, the net just allowed for a different form of transgression, a new border to push against and to respond to when it pushed back on you. It is important to note that this was before the introduction of large-scale, digitized global social networks; we had MySpace, but MySpace was still really just an extension of chatroom and gif-riddled homepage culture, where the streamlining of the representation of the ‘online self’ within the context of a small handful of mainstream social networks was still just a glimmer in the eye of an anime Bettie Page somewhere deep within the realms of a deviantART gallery. When everyone became simultaneously aware of the concept of the “MySpace Angle”, a cognitive rift was created from which there looks to be no turning back from.

Relating in detail the extent of what we looked at online would be an exercise in gross-out one-upmanship; I’ll save that for a spec script when they finally bring back and un-ban Fear Factor (fingers crossed). What I will say, is that having the ability to explore without the concept of a public, digital paper trail of our transgressions looming over our heads allowed for us to really go deep and get weird with the experience (and, like everyone else, we all got caught at least once). Our spectrum of experiences shape the image of who we are and create the lens for how we perceive ourselves; as digital experiences continue to become further enmeshed within and often come to facilitate our pre-adulthood rites of passage, the unflinching gaze of the hyper-curated timeline causes one to constantly reconsider how they are coming across and the voice they project out  into the world. And no one wants to have to unfriend their mom.

<p>
I was a bored teenager living in the suburbs of San Diego. 
</p>
<p>
I was not very outgoing or social, but occasionally went to punk shows, one of the few places I’d feel comfortable.
</p>
<p>
The first website I ever made was a David Bowie fan site on GeoCities when I was 15.
</p>
<p>
I would sign onto AOL and look for people in music chat rooms to discuss punk bands or ‘zines and when that got old I’d check out every gay or bi chat room I could find.
</p>
<p>
My parents would rarely check in on me at night.  If I was quiet, everything was fine.
</p>
<p>
The internet has never offered me what I wanted. I went into chat rooms every night.
</p>
<p>
I remember finding the guys I’d talk to online incredibly boring, but would visit and chat with them anyhow.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I’d chat with a guy for a long time and when he wanted to meet me, I’d send them to the homes of straight guys I had silent crushes on, as a private joke to myself. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes guys I’d meet up with would take me too far away.
</p>
<p>
I remember it being much easier to tell people that I was “bi” so that I wouldn’t have to commit to something as scary and definite as how the term “gay” felt.
</p>
<p>
I remember my family kept our computer by the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
I got into a guy’s car once who had his kid sleeping in the back seat.
</p>
<p>
I remember chat rooms were organized by neighborhood. I lied to hundreds of men online about my age.
</p>
<p>
I would look for open bottles of alcohol in the cupboard, and would down a glass to “build up my courage” before I could meet somebody in person. I could only meet up with guys on the weekends, since I had an early curfew on school nights. 
</p>
<p>
I would go into rooms closer to the city, thinking the further away some guy could take me the better.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn’t get shitfaced, just enough to get me out of the door and into someone’s car.
</p>
<p>
I got into cars with guys who had driven 45 minutes to pick me up at my parents’ house, would drive 45 minutes back to their place, and then 45 minutes to take me back home.
</p>
<p>
I lived in a tough neighborhood, and got made fun of and threatened by gangs regularly at school.
</p>
<p>
I really liked feeling like an escort, like they wanted to take me on a date. I got into cars with guys who were smoking crack.
</p>
<p>
I remember meeting up with guys who didn’t want to do anything but talk because I feel like they knew I was underage.
</p>
<p>
I remember thinking that Gay.com didn’t have as many obnoxious kids like the AOL chat rooms. 
</p>
<p>
I would exchange my AIM name with others.
</p>
<p>
I remember sneaking out to the kitchen after everyone was asleep, quietly unplugging the cord from the phone, and plugging it into the back of the computer.
</p>
<p>
I would make plans to meet people and never show up. 
</p>
<p>
My high school wanted to get rid of the art program because all the kids would ditch class to get high and sell drugs.
</p>
<p>
I would give guys the address of the house across the street, and watch from my garage with the lights off for them to show up. Just to see what they looked like. 
</p>
<p>
I would fantasize about getting into a guys car, them kidnapping me, and never taking me home again.

<h2>ADULTKING DOT COM</h2>
<div class="byline">BS Faulkner</div>
<p>
The website was called AdultKing. That’s a dot com. Not dot net.
</p>
<p>
One time I said to Richie Thomas that all porn sites should be dot org, like dot orgasm. 
</p>
<p>
He said, no, dot com is better, because that’s like dot cum. 
</p>
<p>
And I was like, oh, yeah.
</p>
<p>
OK, so AdultKing was dot com.
</p>
<p>
Richie Thomas was also the one who told me about it. Back when we first got the internet–he at his house, and me at mine–we would each try to find the best porn sites, then trade the names, try to impress the other one. This was before we were jerking off, back when we would just look at the pictures and feel strange complex thoughts, like pleasure, yes, but also disgust, and sadness, and maybe other things too–anger, a little anger, yes, probably. 
</p>
<p>
AdultKing was one that Richie found. We both agreed that it was the best, better than PornZone and even better than AssWorld.
</p>
<p>
AdultKing was very simple–a yellow background, and a list of names in pink Garamond. The names of women, common names, but sexy common names, ones like Tina, Kelly, Brianna, Crystal. Every day a few new names were added. Maybe Laura, Tia, Becky, Jasmine. You never knew what names might be added–it was always a great surprise.
</p>
<p>
And of course it wasn’t just names–you clicked on a name, and you went to another screen, a screen of images–that because of the limitations of the internet in those days–loaded incredibly slowly, almost like erotic Venetian blinds, but lowered excruciatingly slowly, so, so slowly–what a horrible feeling.
</p>
<p>
Lorrie was the best–what a babe. A real dream. One big butt and two nipples the color of blood. Something about nipples the color of blood was always a thing for me. Nipples the color of blood is like blond hair for other guys; it just does something, absolutely drives me wild.
</p>
<p>
But I’m sorry to say this story doesn’t end with Lorrie. 
</p>
<p>
A month, maybe two months after we discovered AdultKing, the name Devon was added. I thought nothing of it. Just one more name.
</p>
<p>
Devon was Katie.
</p>
<p>
Katie was my sister–or so I believe.
</p>
<p>
The first shot showed her butt. Nice butt, I thought.
</p>
<p>
The second shot showed her pussy. Nice pussy, I thought.
</p>
<p>
The third shot was a man’s perspective, a man having his dick sucked. Katie, my sister, looking up at me, sucking a black guy’s dick.
</p>
<p>
I gasped. My eyes widened.
</p>
<p>
The fourth shot was Katie, being drilled in the ass by a black guy in a Ronald Reagan mask.
</p>
<p>
I reached down and unplugged the computer. I never looked at the website again. This happened right after Katie’s suicide–like two months at the most. Whether or not that was her looking up at me–it probably was–I cannot say, but because of that fourth image I have never sodomized a woman, and I face deep and conflicted feelings whenever confronted with the image of the fortieth American president, Mr. Ronald Reagan.
</p>
<p>
And that’s all I want to say about that.

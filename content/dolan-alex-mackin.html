When i was 9 my friend had internet before I ever did so I was always at his house. His older brother was showing us Newgrounds and would later show us Napster. Newgrounds at that time was just a few games made by Tom Fulp and some user content.  Two of the games Club A Seal, where you clubbed a seal, and Assassin, where you could kill celebrities, had got some media attention for being controversial. The only game I vividly remember was UFA, a game where you played an alien and would slaughter humans, anal probe them, and also feed them to this giant monster. It was a really simple game, it can still be played <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/183575" target="_blank">here</a>. Newgrounds is considered an early shock site. although by today's standards seems pretty tame. I was probably too young to understand a lot of what was going on, especially in regards to the anal probing. But I would spend a lot of my teenage years digging for fucked up stuff on shock sites. Which is probably something earlier generations didn’t grow up doing. I always felt that mentally I was consuming something from a different realm than the sort of media my parents or adults in general were consuming, and that was why I was attracted to these sites.

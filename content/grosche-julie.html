I’ve been trying to remember the very first time I used the internet. Before I used “mezzo8” as a pseudonym (borrowed from my pony) on caramail. Before my rat wrote something on the chat window to a guy who was my first and only internet date. But after I destroyed my mother’s computer with a virus from a motorbike game (it destroyed everything and it took her at least 10 years to let me come close to her computer without suspicion again).

So if I remember well it was spring 1998, I was 12 years old, in middle school, in France, taking my first internet discovery class. Quickly enough, I ended up on AOL chat and started communicating with guys from all over. Guys that wanted to be my friend. Guys from Senegal, from Ivory Coast, from Algeria,… For the first time I felt that the world was accessible. A world easy to travel since I had people inviting me all over Africa. Of course they didn’t know I was 12 and I didn’t know I was being scammed since they were just looking for a french wife.

It’s a pretty insignificant experience but I know that that same spring of 1998, Koko the sign language speaker gorilla did as well her first web chat on AOL. This is the end of the conversation she had with her fans:

<p>
KOKO: Huff.* Visitor Koko-love lips lipstick lip.<br />
PENNY: ‘Visitor Koko-love lips lipstick lip.’ She loves you guys.<br />
AOL: I love her too!<br />
PENNY: They say they love you too Koko. They love you.<br />
KOKO: Have good-kiss* go.<br />
PENNY: ‘Have good’ it looked like she said. That was ‘good’ that you love her.<br />
AOL: I’d like to see you some time!<br />
Koko picks up her plastic troll doll.

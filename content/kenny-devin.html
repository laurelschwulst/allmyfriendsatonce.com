I had an Aunt and Uncle who ran a technology consulting company. My Aunt was a beta tester for Microsoft as well as a database specialist, so I had been touching computers since the early 1990s, in between watching VHS tapes, playing with their dogs, fearing their cats, and playing PC games like Mad Dog McRee. By the time the mid-‘90s came around, they were deftly bouncing between MSN, Prodigy, and AOL, and I was hoarding Juno CDs whenever I could find them. I was given access to AOL via their account.

At this time, I was creeping into my tweens, obsessed with Airwalk shoes and was one of 2 skateboarders in my elementary school in Wicker Park on the Northside of Chicago. I was in the gifted program, so I rode a school bus crosstown to get there. An older boy lived in Pilsen (a now incredibly arts-inclined region of the Southwest side) and I shared the bus with him. As a young white kid, he was rare in that area. He was something of a hacker, with a haircut looking like a Backstreet Boy mixed with one of the teens from KIDS. Let’s just say seafoam green was involved in there somewhere. We didn’t like each other, but we both liked The Prodigy, and thought hacking was cool. So, young poser I was, I started hopping online regularly, trying to find out where the 2600 club met, and what the difference between Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Photodeluxe was. I started downloading scripts that I could use in AOL chatrooms. As of this writing, I was hoping to find the website, but there was nothing left but a parking space from someone hoping to make a quick buck. I got some kind of proggie that allowed me to mass message in chat rooms. I think my name was teKNOjunkie then. I would write a message, and it would paste the same message in a huge column of text, over and over again, going through the whole hex spectrum. Needless to say, a few people found that pretty annoying. After a few weeks of this behavior, I was reported. I got in trouble and temporarily lost privileges from my Aunt and Uncle but I didn’t get in that much trouble because it wasn’t porn or bomb-making.

Another website I frequented after those days, however is still around.

When I look back on that time of beige personal computers hiding the multicolored passions of its users, I think what drew me in was the lack of ability to easily customize the experience of the computer to the young person. I loved the challenge. I was excited by changing my desktop theme, making my own Windows 98 startup logo/boot screen, creating avatars, and figuring out how to define myself within this new, uncharted territory...a kind of secret terrain of BBS, IRC, chat rooms, and websites made by aficionados, small businesses, and unhealthy obsessives. Now that there are many rote ways our internet experience is framed, forged, and catered to us, other things must be done.

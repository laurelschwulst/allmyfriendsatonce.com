I was 13
</p>
<p>
I greeted the chat room in my usual manner:
</p>
<p>
“I'm 13. Would anyone like  to fuck me?”
</p>
<p>
Private messages that came immediately.
</p>
<p>
“I'm 34. I would fuck you”, you said.
</p>
<p>
“hi”
</p>
<p>
“hi. are you really 13?”
</p>
<p>
“yes”
</p>
<p>
“nice. have you ever done it before?”
</p>
<p>
“no”
</p>
<p>
“what would you like to do?”
</p>
<p>
“I dunno. describe what you would do to me if we were in the same room now”
</p>
<p>
It makes me slightly uncomfortable with myself to think that we didn't meet until I was 18 and then, you were the one I lost my virginity to. Well, some of it. 
</p>
<p>
It makes me feel weird because it makes me question myself. Why didn't I ever meet someone else in those teenage years in between? Someone I knew in real life. Someone my age.
</p>
<p>
And then when we finally met, I kept asking myself: “what was that for??”
</p>
<p>
I'm 26 now. I hadn't had anything to do with you in at least 6 years. 
</p>
<p>
Until I found out online, last week, that you'd died.

My grandma kept the internet yellow pages in a sling magazine rack, next to her telephone in the living room. The book was only an inch and a half thick, but otherwise matched the dimensions of the two phone books kept in the rack. Her computer was set-up in the basement but the book was a better fit upstairs.
